# python_hangman
Simple Hangman game that can be ran from a terminal.

Looking for help to have the game:
  - Select a random word from a list given.
  - Multiply that words length by the amount of underscores to be initially shown, like so:
  
  The word "apple" will print:
  "_ _ _ _ _"
  
  - Then ask the user x amount of times to guess a letter (each time checking if that letter is in the selected word).
  - After each guess show the underscores again.
  - If there is a match, then replace the guessed letter at the same index of the underscore.
  - After the x amount of guesses, ask the user to guess the word.
  - If the final guess is right, then congratulate them. If not, restart the game.
  
I have already been working on this. However, I am not a super advanced Python programmer yet and I learn a lot by making AND seeing 
programs. It would be great if you guys could post your versions of the game so I can learn a lot from you thanks! :)

BTW - Feel free to add other things to the game, just not too advanced or I may get lost. :')
